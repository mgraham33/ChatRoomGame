Notes:

    Items 1-3 have been successfully implemented for the first release cycle. Item 4 is currently under revision; we desire to find and then implement a method of automatically generating UML Class Diagrams for this project. This is to ensure project documentation accuracy, given that the current implementation process has not prioritized using Class Diagrams for project planning. Only ensuring that the usecase of implemented code is well comprehended.
